# Team Project For Mimo Bootcamp Cohort 26

# Objective
Use the Google Books API to fetch data and display it in the responsive website the team designs

# Overview
As a team, we collaborated to design an awesome project. We kicked things off by brainstorming our ideas and defining our goals. Then, we planned out the development process and communicated it effectively to everyone involved. We used a shared repository to work on the project together, which helped us to stay organized and on track. We also leveraged the power of APIs to gather the data we needed to make our project shine. With the help of DOM manipulation, we were able to create, modify, and style different elements to achieve the perfect look and feel. Finally, we used JavaScript modules to keep our code clean and organized, making it easier to maintain and build upon. By combining all these elements, we created a project that we're proud of and that truly stands out.
